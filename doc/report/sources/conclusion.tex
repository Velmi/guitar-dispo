\section{Conclusion and outlook}

A \ac{PCB} was designed, which works after fixing the main errors. There is also the possibility to further
extend the functionality on this board. It is possible to implement new effects, like a delay or flanger.
Also connecting a \ac{I2C}-display or adding buttons to vary between effects could be done.

To summarize, it can be said, that it is possible to build a digital guitar effects-board that emulates
the filter characteristics of a Wah-Wah-effect using Biquad-filters. The adjustment works smootly, without
any loss of samples. In contrast to the \ac{FIR}-filter implementation, which produce cracking noise
as the filter coefficients are being loaded. There is some way to fix this issue, but the filter characteristics
does not model an actual analog filter, so there is no need to further investigate in this implementation.

A short description of how to use this board can be found in the github repository
