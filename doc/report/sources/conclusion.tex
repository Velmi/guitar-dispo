\section{Conclusion}

To summarize, is can be said, that it is possible to build a guitar effect that emulates
the filter characteristics of a Wah-Wah-effect using Biquad-filters. Although the \ac{ADC} issue has to be fixed it
the future, the result of this project is satisfactory.

The \ac{PCB} had a few errors, which could be fixed.

Also it could be shown, that the \ac{FIR}-filter are not suitable for emulating the filter an analog Wah-Wah-effect
uses.
