\section{Goal}

The goal of this project is to implement a digital bandpass filter, which is variable in its center frequency.
The core of this should be a STM32 microcontroller.

Additionally, an own \ac{PCB} should be developed to integrate all components onto one single board.
There should also be the opportunity to change the software of the microcontroller in order to extend
the functionality. Other effects like reverb, delay or other filters should be possible to implement.
