%// TODO: STM32Nucleo Board, PmodI2S Codec Breakout board, Octave (filtercoeffs), STM32CubeIDE, KiCAD
For the first implementation of basic filtering operations, the evaluation board \textit{Nucleo-H743ZI} of STMicroelectronics
is used. The breakout board \textit{PmodI2S Stereo IN/OUT} is used in order to sample audio data from a 3,5mm jack input.

The choice for the \ac{IDE} fell on the \textit{STM32CubeIDE} as it provides an easy to use installation and
development process.

Digital filters need filter coefficients. As it would be too time consuming to calculate them during runtime, these
coefficients where computed beforehand and then stored in the memory of the microcontroller. Therefore the
software \textit{Octave} was used.

In order to design the \ac{PCB}, the \ac{EDA}-software \textit{KiCAD} was used.
