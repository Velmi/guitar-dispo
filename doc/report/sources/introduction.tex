\section{Introduction}

Guitar pedals are widely used. Classic ones are analog but there is an increasing number of
digital effects due to processing power of PCs or microcontrollers. Both concepts have
reasonable advantages. For the analog concept the unbeatable advantage is that there is
minimal latency. The response of an analog system is the fastest you can get. The downside of analog
processing is the lack of flexibility.

This project is about an implementation of a guitar effect on a microcontroller based platform.
The effect which should be realized is a variable bandpass-filter.
Due to its acoustic characteristics it is also called \frqq Wah-Wah\flqq-effect.
Guitar legends such as Jimi Hendrix, especially on the song Voodoo Child (Slight Return),
and also Eric Clapton used this effect a lot, often in combination with a heavy distortion, also called \textit{Fuzz}
\cite{dailey_e_guitar} \cite{wiki_wahwah}.
